# Transit Tracker
# Author: Jess Inkpen

================================================

This application is modified from an assignment
completed for PROG 2700 at NSCC, Winter 2020.

The application fetches Halifax Transit bus 
location data (JSON) and transforms the data 
into GeoJSON objects. I used the Leaflet API
to create markers for buses on routes 1 -14,
and add them to a map. The markers update every
10 seconds.
